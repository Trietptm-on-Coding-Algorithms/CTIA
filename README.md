# Cyber Threat Intelligence Appliance (CTIA)
# Note: this currently doesn't work
GOALS:

- Create a free, expandable, open-source, easily/rapidly deployable, Intelligence appliance for CSIRTs, CERTs, SOCs, etc.

- Utilize docker containers or a private cloud setup that includes instances of well documented/supported cyber threat intelligence tools


# Candidate tools:

- Rancher: Container management/orchestration

- Cortex: Indicator Enrichment

- MISP: Intelligence collection/aggregation/enrichment tool

- Maltego Transform server: For hosting custom Maltego Transforms locally

- Ejabberd: Maltego Collaboration

- Mattermost: For team communication

- FAME: Malware sandbox

- Possibly some kali boxes with vnc, but we'll see.
